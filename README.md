Welcome to QuantumSimLite application made by Maxime Vinteler (@maximev1314 on Twitter) ! This document provides essential information to help you navigate and make the most of the functionalities offered by my software.

## Key Features:

1. **Eigenstates Visualization:**
   - Explore eigenstates for any potential in 1D and 2D for a single particle.
   - View detailed visualizations in the application.
   - The data is saved and can be easily used for your own work.

2. **Quantum Dynamics:**
   - Conduct quantum dynamics simulations within the application.
   - Experience real-time changes in the system.
   - The data is also saved and can be easily used for your own work.

3. **Downloadable Resources:**
   - Download eigenstates and dynamic simulations (FFMPEG require for video).
   - Note: Saving images or videos may cause a temporary freeze in the application.

## Important Information:

- **Compatibility:**
   - This version of the application is designed for Windows operating systems.
   - For users on other systems, an alternative version compatible with all systems is available at https://github.com/MaximeV1314/QuantumSimLite-Win-MacOS-Linux

- **Information Tools:**
   - Access crucial details by hovering over the "blue information icons" in the application.
   - Read and follow the provided information for correct usage of the software.
   - Access to the eigenstates and eigenenergies data in VP folder, .bz2 (eigenstates) and .csv (eigenenergies) files. Note that for 2D, you need to reshape 1D arrays of shape N^2 into an array of 2D shape (NxN).
   - Access to the dynamics data in VP folder --> dynamic folder. Files with "info" as a prefix contain mean value and standard deviation data for position and momentum representations. Note that for 2D, you need to reshape 1D arrays of shape N^2 into an array of 2D shape (NxN).

- **Media Folder:**
   - Locate additional resources, including videos and images, in the 'media' folder.
   - Utilize these materials for a richer experience and deeper insights.

 ## System Requirements:

Ensure your system meets the following requirements :
- Operating System: Windows
- Disk Space: 380 MB of available space

## Installation:

1. Download the repository (Code --> Download ZIP) at https://github.com/MaximeV1314/QuantumSimLite-Windows
2. Unzip the file in your directory.
3. (Optionnal) FFMPEG is require to download dynamic videos. I recommend following this straightforward tutorial to install it : https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows
4. Execute QuantumSimLite.exe (note that the first time you open it, the application may take some time).

## Usage Guidelines:

1. Open the application and explore the various features available.
2. Refer to the information tools for guidance on using specific functionalities.
3. Take advantage of the media folder to access additional resources.
